`C:\Program Files\Go` installation folder for win10

`package main` declares the parent module

`import fmt` grants access to input/output

`func main() {}` is the executable code of each go file

`fmt.Println()` stands for print line

`go run ./main.go` to run a go file in the same directory

`go help` also helps a lot
